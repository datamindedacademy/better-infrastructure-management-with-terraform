# Refactoring

It's a well-known fact that programmers spend most of their time reading code, instead of writing it.
One of the most important practices in writing software is the refactoring of existing code, with the aim of
making it more readable and hence more maintainable.

## Goal of this exercise

In this exercise, you will clean up (yay!) someone else's mess. Separate the main.tf into separate files
in order to make the terraform codebase more readable for you and your colleagues. You don't need to `apply` the resources, being able to `plan` them is good enough.
