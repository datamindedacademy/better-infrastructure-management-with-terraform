# Provider configuration

Most of the Terraform provider plugins are open source, and the most popular providers release new versions on a regular basis, 
containing the latest resources / data sources, as well as updates and bug fixes. 

## Goal of this exercise

The `sns.tf` file contains Terraform code to create an SNS topic on AWS, which is a kind of communication channels to which
one can publish and subscribe. Try to apply the code in the folder of this exercise. Why does it fail? How can you fix this? How
can you prevent this from happening in the future?
